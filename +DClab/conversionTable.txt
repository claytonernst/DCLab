%Programming Goals
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
make ParameterOptimization work (maybe scrap it and start over.....)
(this may get rid of some private function PolyDataset and others....)
make ParameterOptimization work with Feasible set too...
feasible set sampler
convex outer bound of feasible set?
bounding box of feasible set
make sure DClab.randomPoint works and does what you want
write good test functions
dispProps for everybody
other GRI demos like jpc04.....m
