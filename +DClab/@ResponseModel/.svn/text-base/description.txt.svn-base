This object is always scalar.
If the model is described by a dcModel mfile, no transformations are
incorporated. They are assumed to be linear in both the variable and the response.
The corresponding fields in the object will be empty to save memory

Algebriac models may be linXlinY, logXlinY, linXlogY, and logXlogY.

ResponseObservations may have uncertainty supplied as interval,
percent, log10-interval. How we treat this in software depends on the
available surfaces. However, we should report to the user in a way he
understands. It gets tougher if additionally there is modeling
uncertainty. For now, we can prevent combination of things we can't
deal with. Specifically, if modeling uncertainty is present in a
dcModel mfile, it can't be used with log10-interval observational
uncertainty. If the algebraic model is in linY, it works with
interval.

So for dcModels, modeling uncertainty should also be interval, percent, or
log10-interval. 

Similar for algebraic models. 

We'll have an option for multipliers wrt observational uncertainty,
and wrt total uncertainty. The later will not be available if the
uncertainty types are incompatible.

ModeledResponse(algForm,domain,biasBound)

first input can be matrix (assume linXlinY) or struct with fields
.algForm, .respTrans, and .varTrans 

third input can be double (assume interval) or struct with fields
.bound and .type
